# Problem & Jobs-to-be-Done

## Core problem
Partner teams are **under-resourced & reactive**. Information overload prevents consistent, high-quality **partner moves** (outreach, listings, co-marketing).

## Job-to-be-Done (JTBD)
> “Given our objectives, tell us the **top partner moves this week**, provide **ready-to-send messages**, and optionally **run them**, so we get **more replies, meetings, and launches** without hiring.”

## Symptoms
- Noise from blogs/PR/LinkedIn; no prioritization.
- Drafting good outreach is slow.
- No simple view of “what changed for our partners” tied to goals.

## Desired outcomes
- Weekly 3–10 actionable, prioritized recommendations.
- Faster path to **replies and meetings**.
- Traceable reasoning (evidence + score breakdown).
