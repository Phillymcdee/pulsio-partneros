# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

## Company stage
- **Seed–Series B B2B SaaS** (5–150 employees).
- Lean GTM; partnerships are founder-led or 0–1 FTE.

## Roles
- **Primary buyer:** Head of Partnerships / BizDev Lead / Founder.
- **Champions:** Head of Growth, RevOps, PMM.
- **Users:** Partner/Alliance managers; founders wearing the hat.

## Pain signals
- “We track partners in Sheets/Notion.”
- “We miss windows—funding rounds, launches, marketplace changes.”
- “We can’t justify a full-time partner manager yet.”
- “We need more partner-sourced meetings / co-marketing.”

## Adjacent ICPs (channel GTM)
- Accelerators/incubators (cohorts), venture studios, app agencies.

## Exclusions (for now)
- Late-stage enterprises with heavy PRM/PRM-like tooling that requires deep integrations.
