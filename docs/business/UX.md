# User Experience (MVP)

## First run (≤5 min)
1. **Sign in** (magic link).
2. **Add partners/targets** (paste list); auto-detect RSS/press feeds.
3. **Select 2–3 objectives** (integrations, co-sell, co-market, marketplace); set priorities.
4. **Choose cadence + channel** (daily/weekly; email/Slack).
5. App backfills 7 days → creates first **Partner Pulse**.

## Digest (email/Slack)
Each item shows:
- **Partner — Signal — Score**
- **Why it matters** (vs objectives)
- **Recommended action**
- **Outreach draft** (copy button)
- Controls: **👍/👎**, **Mark N/A**, **Run this for me**.

## Dashboard
- **Top Insights** (ranked list; filters + score breakdown).
- **Partner Page** (timeline of signals & insights).
- **Objectives** (reorder priorities).
- **Settings** (cadence, channels).

## Weekly rhythm (90 min total)
- Approve & send 2–4 actions Monday.
- React to “hot” high-score signals mid-week.
- Friday check: two Partner Pages; nudge one deeper play (e.g., marketplace app).

## Feedback loop
- Thumbs up/down trains precision.
- Monthly objective refresh rebiases suggestions.
