# Risks & Guardrails

## Risks
- “Nice feed, no action” → add one-click actions + service overlay.
- Noisy signals → precision@5 tracking; per-user source weights.
- Budget pushback → position as **decisions + drafts**; offer pilot & service tier.
- Incumbents → integrate/sync; be the **intelligence + action** layer.

## Kill/adjust criteria
- <20% pilot → paid conversion across 10 pilots.
- Reply rate consistently <8% with tuned plays.
- Precision@5 <60% after two iteration cycles.

## Guardrails
- Public sources only by default; evidence links for all suggestions.
- Tenant isolation; minimal PII; prompt hygiene.
